# CS178 Flask Movie App

# This is a web application that allows users to sign up, log in, and manage a movie database. The app demonstrates integration with both AWS DynamoDB and AWS RDS (MySQL) to handle user authentication and CRUD operations on movie data.

# - Once authenticated, users can:
# - Create new movie entries
# - Read all saved movies
# - Delete movies
# - Access to movie-related pages is restricted to logged-in users using Flask session management.
